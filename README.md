Title: Horisoen 

Description:
    The purpose of the website is to help costumers with their needs in:
        -Search Engine Optimization
        -Online Reputation Management
        -Social Media Marketing
A description of each service can be found by clicking on the right hand side buttons.

The right side section on the website describes the bellow:
        -Lead Generation
        -Brand Awareness
        -Cost Management

I made the following changes:
    -added comments for every single tag;
    -changed  <title>website</title> to <title>Horiseon</title> to distinguish the 
        title of the website;
    -removed <div> tag and replaced with <header>;
    -changed <div class="hero"> to <div class="banner"> to distinguish the banner 
        of the website;
    -changed <div class="content"> to <div class="main"> because "content" is 
        not a semantic HTML element;
    -changed <div class="benetits"> to <div class="aside"> because "benefits" is 
        not a semantic HTML element;
    - added "id" attribute inside of <div class="search-engine-optimization"> because 
        the button wasn't working;
    -removed <div> tag and replaced with <footer>;
